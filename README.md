# Observables: Basic ProjectüöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Run npm i to download the necessary dependencies (node_modules and files).

Run ng serve -o (or ng s --o) for a development server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Observables Covered
Throughout this project, you will encounter various observables and operators. Here's a list of what you'll learn:

01 - Interval: Observing values emitted at regular intervals.

02 - Custom Observable: Building custom observables using both deprecated and new syntax.

03 - Error Completion: Handling errors within observables.

04 - Observable Completion: Understanding how observables complete.

05 - Map Operator and Pipe: Transforming emitted values using the map operator and piping multiple operators together.

06 - Filter Operator: Filtering emitted values based on a condition.

07 - Subjects: Understanding and using subjects for multicasting.

08 - Timer Operator: Emitting values after a specified delay.

09 - fromEvent Operator: Creating observables from DOM events.

10 - of & from Operator: Creating observables from various data types.

11 - Pluck Operator: Extracting specific properties from emitted objects.

12 - Reduce Operator: Reducing emitted values into a single value.

13 - Take Operator: Taking a specified number of values from an observable.

14 - Tap Operator: Performing side effects without affecting the emitted values.

15 - Range Operator: Creating an observable of a sequence of numbers.

16 - MergeMap Operator: Flattening observables and merging their emissions.

17 - SwitchMap Operator: Switching to a new observable each time the source emits.

18 - ExhaustMap Operator: Ignoring new observables while the current one is still active.

19 - ConcatMap Operator: Concatenating observables, emitting values in order.

### By working through this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of observables and how to leverage them effectively in your applications.

#### Note: While this project covers a wide range of observables and operators, not all concepts may be fully explored here. You may need to explore additional resources to deepen your understanding of certain topics.
